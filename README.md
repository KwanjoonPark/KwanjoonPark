Hi there, I'm Kwanjoon Park 👋

🚀 Robot Perception Engineer | Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap

I am a software engineering undergraduate and aspiring robotics researcher, passionate about giving robots the "eyes" to interact with the physical world. My primary focus is 6-DoF Pose Estimation, Synthetic Data Generation, and Secure System Development.

Currently, I am researching at ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), developing robust vision pipelines for industrial manipulation.

🔬 Key Research & Projects

🤖 Robust 6-DoF Pose Estimation for Industrial Manipulation

Research Intern @ ETRI Energy Intelligence Lab | Jan. 2026 - Present

Developed a vision pipeline to estimate the precise 6-DoF pose of VCB (Vacuum Circuit Breaker) panels for robotic manipulation without manual labeling.

Problem: Lack of 3D pose datasets for specific industrial parts and vulnerability of marker-based methods to occlusion/lighting.

Solution:

Designed a Synthetic Data Pipeline using Intel RealSense D455 and ArUco markers for automated Ground Truth generation.

Implemented a Geometry-Aware Background Segmentation algorithm (Canny Edge + FloodFill + ConvexHull) to isolate objects from noisy industrial backgrounds.

Constructed a dataset of 1,200+ images with automated labeling, enabling domain randomization experiments.

Tech: Python, ROS 2, OpenCV, RealSense SDK.
